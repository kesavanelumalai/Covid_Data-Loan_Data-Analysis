 AI/ML Projects: COVID-19 Analysis & Loan Prediction
This repository contains two machine learning projects showcasing data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using real-world datasets:

1️⃣ COVID-19 Data Analysis

2️⃣ Loan Eligibility Prediction

Each project is implemented using Python with Jupyter Notebooks, and structured to reflect practical use cases and industry-level standards.

🔬 1️⃣ COVID-19 Data Analysis
📌 Description
This project focuses on analyzing the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-time data. It covers infection and death trends across countries and visualizes how the virus has spread over time.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases.

Identify global and country-specific patterns.

Use visualizations to show trends and peaks.

Compare mortality and recovery rates.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook

COVID-19 dataset (from Kaggle or Johns Hopkins)

📊 Features
Time-series plots for global and regional case trends.

Moving averages and growth curves.

Mortality vs. recovery visual comparison.

Country-wise comparison and heatmaps.

💰 2️⃣ Loan Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Description
This project predicts whether a customer is eligible for a bank loan based on demographic and financial data. It uses supervised ML algorithms to classify loan status.

🎯 Objectives
Automate loan eligibility decision-making.

Build and evaluate classification models.

Identify important features influencing approvals.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Jupyter Notebook

Loan dataset (Kaggle - public domain)

📊 Features
Data cleaning (missing values, encoding).

Feature engineering and selection.

Model training and evaluation.

Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.
